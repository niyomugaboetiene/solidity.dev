// DAO is smart contract that allows people to propose action, vote proposal, execute the winning proposals
// DAO -> Decentralized Autonomous Organization
// Autonomous -> runs automatically based on rule runs on smart contract
// Organization -> a group of people with shared goal
// on ETHereum DAO let people pool money together and vote how to spend it without needing bank
